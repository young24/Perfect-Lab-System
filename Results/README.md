For the results folder, we designed this folder to only hold those finalized results for publications. Intermediate results such as analysis results should be placed in the Data folder which can auto-sync with server.
In this folder, binary files such as MS Office files will be uploaded to GitHub with Git-LFS (large file storage). You need to manually pull those files when you need them.
```
git lfs pull -I'PATH/FILENAME'
```

**Markdown is the suggested format to write documents (instead of Word and Excel files), Markdown can also be used to make slides. Checkout [here](https://gitpitch.com/). However I understand the transition is painful. But you can just spend 5 minutes to learn Markdown which might gain you a job in the future.**
