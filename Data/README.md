For the Data folder, only link files will be tracked and uploaded to GitHub. Moreover, all data put in the Data folder would be automatically synchronized to the corresponding folder in the server.

**Please do not manually add any files except links to the ./links folder.**

[link to data](ftp://222.195.69.205/wenlab/Young/test)

If you need any help, or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/young24/Perfect-Lab-System/issues). I'd like to help you.
