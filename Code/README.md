For the code folder, source files can be uploaded directly to GitHub. However, generated objects (e.g., .o), compressed objects (e.g., .zip) and large data files (e.g., .avi, .yaml) should not be placed in this folder, and they would not be uploaded to GitHub.

Test data files should be placed in the Data folder.

If you need any help, or have questions, please post an issue on [here](https://github.com/young24/Perfect-Lab-System/issues). I'd like to help you.
